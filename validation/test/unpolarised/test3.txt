# Fresnel reflectivity from an air-water interface
# Almost identical to test2, except that the slabs are
# generated from slicing up an error function. Each
# microslab is given a zero roughness.
# The purpose of this test is to check how different
# implementations treat roughnesses. Both test2 and
# test3 represent a Gaussian roughness of an interface
# and should give identical reflectivities.
